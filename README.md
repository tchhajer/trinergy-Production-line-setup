# Trinergy Production Line Setup

## Overview

This project involved developing a production line setup for **Trinergy UPS systems** with the goal of improving assembly efficiency, reducing material handling time, and maximizing space utilization. It was conducted as part of a manufacturing optimization initiative.

## Objective

- Design a detailed production layout for Trinergy UPS systems.
- Evaluate module movement paths to identify bottlenecks.
- Propose layout changes that enhance operational efficiency.

## Key Contributions

- Conducted detailed evaluations of the workflow and module movement throughout the facility.
- Proposed layout improvements that included the strategic placement of equipment and staging areas.
- Designed and integrated a **vertical storage unit** to address space constraints and support just-in-time (JIT) assembly practices.
- Created a comprehensive layout plan using AutoCAD.

## Tools & Skills Used

- **AutoCAD**: for layout design and visualization.
- **Manufacturing Planning**: to analyze and optimize workflow.
- **Lean Manufacturing Principles**: including space optimization and JIT strategies.

## Impact

- Reduced material handling time and improved layout ergonomics.
- Enabled smoother movement of Trinergy modules through the production stages.
- Contributed to a more organized and space-efficient shop floor.
